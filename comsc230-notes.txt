Point this project to a repo on your Github:

In VSCode terminal:

// Command to see the origin url:

git remote show origin

// After you clone it you should see:

* remote origin
  Fetch URL: https://github.com/rhodyapps/Comsc230-friendlyeats
  Push  URL: https://github.com/rhodyapps/Comsc230-friendlyeats
  HEAD branch: master
  Remote branch:
    master tracked

// In your Github, create a new repository for this project.
// copy the url to your repo for this project
// then remove the origin (if it is pointing to rhodyapps)

git remote rm origin

// now you can re-point the local repo to your new github repo:

git remote add origin <paste in the url of your github repo for this project>

// Check it again
git remote show origin

// Make a change in one of the files (ie: add a blank line to MainActivity.java) and
// Use the VSCode github function (icon on the left) to push the change to github.
// Since this is the initial commit, it will push all of the code.
